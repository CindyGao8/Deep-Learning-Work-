## Multi-Class Classification on Shuttle Dataset using Decision Trees and Boosting
This project focuses on multi-class classification using the Shuttle dataset, which consists of 58,000 instances, 10 features (9 numerical and 1 categorical), and 7 output classes. The dataset is imbalanced, as observed in the class distribution plot.
The primary goal is to apply Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting to classify instances efficiently and evaluate model performance.
